# Huggingface Transformers.js Development

## What are we doing?

To learn and experiment with Huggingface Transformers.js we develop a "Hotdog or Not" 
application where the machine learning models run in the browser.

### Huggingface transformers.js

Huggingface - a library, platform and community for machine learning.

State-of-the-art Machine Learning for the web. Run ðŸ¤— Transformers directly in your browser, with no need for a server!

Transformers.js uses [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) to run models in the browser.

ONNX Runtime is an open-source software framework designed to accelerate machine learning (ML) model inference, it's 
a cross-platform runtime environment that can execute models created in various deep learning frameworks.

Machine learning inference is the process of using a trained model to make prediction on new data.
